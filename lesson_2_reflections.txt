What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The file .git is created that logs every commit you do in this repository. Whereever (in 
	whichever folder) you initialize the new repository, that is the root of that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	It's the link between the working directory and repository. It gives you a chance to commit
	only selected files you want to commit, other files are just files in the working directory, 
	waiting to be good (relevant) enough to be added into the repository.
